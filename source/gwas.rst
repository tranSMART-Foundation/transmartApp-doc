GWAS
====

The genome-wide association study (GWAS) tool is used to find
relationships between genetic variants in different individuals and a
trait of interest. Though the tool is called "GWAS," the feature
supports genome-wide association studies (GWAS), expressional
quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and metabolic associations (mQTL).

This application is comprised of a GWAS page to query across GWAS, a
data loading panel to import GWAS files, and an interactive Manhattan
Plot application called the "Genome-Wide Association Visual Analyzer"
(GWAVA).

Searching for a Study
---------------------

The GWAS search feature is similar to the search feature of the Browse
tool. You can build a search query using keywords, pre-defined filters,
or any combination.

Features of the GWAS page are shown below:

Keyword searches and the Active Filters pane work as they do with the
Browse tool. For information, see *Defining Search Filters* (page 4) and
*Managing Active Filters* (page 7).

GWAS Filter Browsers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Filter Browser pane contains the following GWAS filter categories:

|image152|

There are two types of GWAS filter browsers:

-  **Resource** browsers that let you select a filter for a particular
   tranSMART resource, such as studies, analyses, and data types (for
   example, GWAS, metabolic GWAS, GWAS Fail, eQTL).

-  **Human genome region of interest** browser that lets you specify the
   region of the human genome to investigate.

Resource Browsers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resource browsers (studies, analyses, data types) all operate the
same way.

To select a filter from a resource browser:

#.  Click the name of the filter browser category to open; for
    example, Study as shown below:

    |image153|

#.  In the browser popup window, filter options are listed on the left.
    Select a filter by clicking the plus sign (**+**) to the right of the
    filter name. The selected filter is added to the right part of the
    browser.

    |image154|

    With filters that have long names, note that:

    -   Even if the plus sign (**+**) is partially obscured by the name, you
        can still click it.

    -   Hovering the mouse pointer over the name displays the full name.

#.  Optionally:

    -   Add additional filters within this browser by repeating the previous step.

    -   Narrow the list of filter options by typing characters into the text
        box at the top left of the browser. tranSMART lists all those filters
        whose names include the characters, in a contiguous string, anywhere
        in the name (not case-sensitive):

        |image155|

    -   Select all the filters in the list by clicking **Add all**:

        |image156|

    -   Remove a selected filter by clicking the minus sign (**–**) to the
        right of the selected filter name, or remove all selected filters by
        clicking **Remove all**:

        |image157|

#.  When finished selecting filters from this browser, click **Select**
    at the bottom right of the browser. Your selections will be added to
    the Active Filters area.

#.  Optionally, select filters from a different browser by repeating the
    above steps.

All of the selected filters will become part of the same search query
and be included in the Active Filters area.

Region of Interest Browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Region of Interest browser lets you specify a particular area of the
human genome as a search filter.

.. note::
    Search filters for regions of interest do not filter out studies and 
    analyses that omit the region of interest. However, the only records 
    returned for an analysis are those that contain the specified region 
    of interest. If an analysis does not reference the region of 
    interest, no records are returned for that analysis.

To specify a region of interest:

#.  In the Filter Browser pane, click **Region of Interest**.

    The Region of Interest browser appears:

    |image158|

#.  Define the filter as described in the following table:

Browse the Study List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before a search query is defined in Active Filters, the GWAS page is
displayed in Analysis View with all studies listed. You can view the
entire list of studies using the scroll bar on the page.

As you add search filters to the Active Filters area, the studies that
appear in the list narrows, based on the search filters you have
defined.

You can perform the following tasks for a study:

-   View metadata for the study.

    To do so, click the icon to the left of the study name:

    |image163|

    Information about the study is displayed, such as the description of the
    study, the institution that conducted the study, and data availability.

#.  Optionally, filter the data results through one or both of the
    following methods and then click \ **OK** (do not press Enter or
    Return):

    -   Specify a p-value in the **P-value cutoff** field.

        Only those rows whose **p-value** column contains a p-value at or below
        the specified p-value are returned.

        Setting **P-value-cutoff** to **0.0** disables the p-value filter.

    -   Specify a search keyword in the **Search** field. All data columns
        are searchable.

#.  Optionally, click **Export as CSV** to export the filtered data to a
    comma-separated text file.

#.  Optionally, click **QQ Plot** to display the filtered data in a QQ
    Plot. To export the image, click **Export as PNG**.

Table View
~~~~~~~~~~

Table View lets you perform the following tasks:

-   View analysis data from multiple analyses in a single table.

-   Filter the rows of analysis data by p-value and/or a search keyword.

-   Export the analysis data to a comma-separated text file.

.. note::
    The contents of Table View are determined by the filters in the Active Filters area. 
    Selecting an individual analysis by checking the check box next to the analysis name in 
    Analysis View will not cause the analysis to be included in Table View. 

To view analysis data in Table View:

#.  Define search filters that will retrieve the records you want to view.

    .. note::
        Be sure to filter your search as narrowly as possible. Not only will this result in a table that contains only the most pertinent data, but it will reduce the time required to retrieve and display the data.   

#.  Click the **Table View** button:

    |image168|

#.  Optionally, filter the data results through one or both of the
    following methods and then click \ **OK** (do not press Enter or
    Return):

    -   Specify a p-value in the **P-value cutoff** field.

        Only those rows whose **p-value** column contains a p-value at or below
        the specified p-value are returned.

        Setting **P-value-cutoff** to **0.0** disables the p-value filter.

    -   Specify a search keyword in the **Search** field. All data columns
        are searchable.

    .. note::
        Setting a p-value or search keyword in Analysis View for a particular analysis 
        will not filter the data that appears in Table View. To filter Table View records by 
        these parameters, you must define the filters in Table View itself.   

#.  Optionally, click **Export as CSV** to export the filtered data to a
    comma-separated text file.

Manhattan Plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view GWAS data from selected analyses in a Manhattan Plot.
Manhattan Plots are generated by the Genome-Wide Association Visual
Analyzer (GWAVA) application.

The GWAVA application lists all GWAS analyses for selection. GWAVA can
run and display multiple analyses at the same time on the same Manhattan
Plot.

Only standard GWAS data can be viewed in GWAVA. eQTL and mQTL data are
not supported.

Alternatively, GWAVA can be launched and used as a separate application
independent of the tranSMART user interface

To display analysis data in a Manhattan Plot:

#.  Optionally, define search filters using the keyword search and
    Filter Browser features.

    Doing so will reduce the number of studies and analyses that you will
    need to browse through in Analysis View when selecting the analyses to
    include in the Manhattan Plot.

    .. note::
        If you define any gene or gene signature filters, those genes will appear in the GWAVA Gene Model Selection window.   

#.  In Analysis View, do one of the following:

    -   Select the check box next to each analysis whose data will be
        included in the Manhattan Plot:

        |image161|

    At least one analysis must be selected.

    -   Click the **Select All Visible Analyses** tab to select all analyses
        for all listed studies.

        |image170|

#.  Click the **Manhattan Plot** tab.

#.  In the Manhattan Plot Options dialog box, select the human genome
    version to use as the basis for the selected data, and optionally,
    specify a p-value cutoff:

    |image171|

    If you specify a p-value cutoff, the only data included in the Manhattan
    Plot will be from records containing the specified p-value or below.

#.  Click **Plot**.

    The GWAVA application opens.

#.  In the GWAVA window, select the analysis or analyses of interest from
    the left and click the **Include** button. The selected items are
    moved into the panel on the right:

    |image172|

#.  Enter a list of genes or RSIDs (one or more):

    |image173|

#.  Click the **Retrieve Data** button at the bottom to begin running the
    analysis/analyses.

    |image174|

#.  Once the job status moves from Working to Success, the job is
    complete.

    |image175|

#.  From the GWAVA Gene Model Selection window, select the completed
    analysis/analyses and click the **Colored Plot** button.

    |image176|

#.  The Manhattan Plot is displayed in the Results tab of the GWAVA window:

    |image177|

#.  Optionally, manipulate the image using the features on the bottom of
    the window or by directly highlighting the plot itself. For example,
    the recombination rate can optionally be displayed, the plot can be
    zoomed in and out on the chromosomal range, and horizontal lines can
    be added to the plot as needed.
